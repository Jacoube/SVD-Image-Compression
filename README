Hello! This code is for a presentation for my linear algebra class. The main file is modified code from Steve Brunton's

I also used information from Anna Zemlyanova's Applied Projects for an Introductory Linear Algebra Class:

As well as ZeroBone's article:

Note this code as been partially written and debugged using ChatGPT.
